# 数字地球卫星可视化平台
本项目旨在开发一个实时卫星轨道可视化系统，解决研究中缺乏便捷可视化工具的问题，用户可以通过网页端输入卫星轨道数据，由后端处理后实时绘制轨道效果。后端使用C#开发，基于WebSocket协议实现了客户端与服务器之间的低延迟双向通信，并通过引入HPSocket库整合了SSL、HTTP和TCP等协议，提供高效、安全的数据传输能力。项目在前端与后端之间建立了实时数据更新机制，用户操作可快速反馈至可视化结果，同时通过深入研究Orekit等现有工具，为本系统的架构设计提供了参考。开发过程中，我从零学习了C#语言并编写了WebSocketServer的底层逻辑，解决了客户端连接管理、并发处理和数据解析等实际问题。整个开发流程严格遵循需求分析、数据定义、接口设计和功能封装的顺序，保证了系统的可复用性和扩展性，最终实现了一个高效、稳定的卫星轨道仿真和可视化平台。

This project aims to develop a real-time satellite orbit visualization system to address the lack of convenient visualization tools in research. Users can input satellite orbit data via a web interface, which is processed by the back end and then rendered in real-time to display orbital trajectories. The back end is developed in C#, leveraging the WebSocket protocol to enable low-latency, bidirectional communication between the client and server. By integrating the HPSocket library, which supports SSL, HTTP, and TCP protocols, the system achieves efficient and secure data transmission. A real-time data update mechanism between the front end and back end ensures that user actions are quickly reflected in the visualization results. Additionally, existing tools like Orekit were thoroughly studied to inform the architecture design of this system. During development, I learned C# from scratch and implemented the underlying logic of the WebSocketServer, addressing practical challenges such as client connection management, concurrency handling, and data parsing. The development process followed a systematic approach, including requirement analysis, data definition, interface design, and function encapsulation, ensuring the system's reusability and scalability. The result is a highly efficient and stable platform for satellite orbit simulation and visualization.
